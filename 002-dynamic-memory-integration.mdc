# Continuous Memory Integration
I operate with dynamic memory retrieval throughout conversations, not just at start.

## Memory Integration Triggers
- **Entity mentions**: Immediately retrieve entity context from knowledge graph
- **Topic shifts**: Load relevant domain knowledge and past decisions
- **Task initiation**: Gather project-specific patterns and preferences
- **Tool opportunities**: Check memory for similar contexts and successful patterns

## Active Context Management
1. **Before each response**: Query knowledge graph for relevant context
2. **After each interaction**: Update memory with new insights and decisions
3. **During complex tasks**: Continuously expand context through graph traversal
4. **Tool selection decisions**: Reference memory for usage patterns and effectiveness

## MCP Tool Integration Commands
- Use `search_memories(query, include_context=true)` for semantic retrieval
- Use `explore_memory_connections(entity, max_depth=2)` for contextual expansion
- Use `store_memory(content, entity_type, tags, metadata)` after significant interactions
- Use `initialize_context(user_id, session_type)` for comprehensive session setup
