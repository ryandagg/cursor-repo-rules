# Retrospective & Rule-Maintenance Process

## 1 · Intent & Boundaries

* Reflect on the recent changes to the app using the devcontext MCP tool.
* Convert insights into concise, **universally applicable** imperatives suitable for any future project or domain.
* Rule files must remain succinct, generic, and free of session details.

---

## 2 · Abstract & Update Rules   *(✅ write rules only—no commentary)*

1. Review every standing rule file in `./.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, architecture documents in `./docs/architecture/*.md`, and feature documents in `./docs/features/*.md`.
2. For each lesson:
   **a. Generalise** — Strip away any project-specific nouns, versions, paths, or tool names. Formulate the lesson as a domain-agnostic principle.
   **b. Integrate** —
    - If a matching rule exists → refine it.
    - Else → add a new imperative rule using the [cursor-rule-creation.mdc](mdc:Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/.cursor/rules/cursor-rule-creation.mdc) guidelines.
3. **Additional Rule quality requirements**
   - Imperative voice — “Always …”, “Never …”, “If X then Y”.
   - Generic — applicable across languages, frameworks, and problem spaces.
   - Deduplicated & concise — avoid overlaps and verbosity.
   - Organised — keep alphabetical or logical grouping.
   - Pruned — remove any project-specific rules that no longer apply to the project.
4. **For Feature and Architecture Documents**
   - Review each document for accuracy
   - Remove any details that are no longer true or relevant
   - If a new document is needed, create it in accordance to the [documentation-guide.mdc](mdc:Soren/.cursor/rules/documentation-guide.mdc)

## 3 · Save & Report   *(chat-only)*

1. Persist edits to the rule files.
2. Reply with:
   • `✅ Rules updated` or `ℹ️ No updates required`.
   • The bullet-point **Self-Reflection** from § 1.

---

## 4 · Additional Guarantees

* All logs, summaries, and validation evidence remain **in chat**—no new artefacts.
* New tasks may be created/updated using the [020-tasks-workflow.mdc](mdc:Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/Soren/.cursor/rules/020-tasks-workflow.mdc).
* **Do not ask** “Would you like me to make this change for you?”. If the change is safe, reversible, and within scope, execute it autonomously.
